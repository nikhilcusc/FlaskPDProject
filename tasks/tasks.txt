Changed from D3 to Chartjs
1 ParseDate - done
2 Figure out why temperature does not load completely
3 Figure out how to zoom in the line chart
4 Is it possible to plot both temperature and consumption in one graph?
5 What would be a good way to parse so much data? Playing with idea of filtering at source(in python) vs filtering in Javascript.
