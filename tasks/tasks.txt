!!Changed from D3 to Chartjs
1 Add a slider to change the number of values on the chart.
~	1.1 Have a slider between 2 charts.~
~	1.2 Have an update function to change the values.
		Idea is to take every nth values, where n is selected on the slider.~
	1.3 Make the slider bigger, and move it to center of the page.
~2 Add another slider to select the range.~
~	2.1 Figure out how to change the start and end of the array.~
~3 Do not need a different function to update start, end and nth values. Can be integrated into one function. ~
~4 Maybe try to show both temperature and consumption in one chart. Scaling might be an issue here.~
5 How to quicken loading of all points?
6 Display dates instead of index values next to sliders.
~Works now 1 Consumption does not show up when I try all the data. Works when I have only 1000 data points.~



!! this was D3 
1 ParseDate - done
2 Figure out why temperature does not load completely - if anyone finds the answer - please post it here - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57137577/d3-linechart-plots-only-some-points
3 Figure out how to zoom in the line chart
4 Is it possible to plot both temperature and consumption in one graph?
5 What would be a good way to parse so much data? Playing with idea of filtering at source(in python) vs filtering in Javascript.
